Sweaters are a large part of perfect fall weather (may I even say... sweaterweather?). Is it really fall without sweaters? In my opinion, it isn't. I guess you could argue that fall is not fall without pumpkin spice lattes, pumpkin patches, and the famous spooky season. But sweaters are the epicenter for everything fall! Drinking a pumpkin spice latte? Wear a sweater. Going to a pumpkin patch? Definitely wear a sweater. Going out for Halloween or doing anything for spooky season? Wear a sweater! Sweaters are perfect for any fall activity, and they are very fashionable and can keep you warm!

It is important to have some nice sweaters for the fall weather, so I have added links to the sweaters in the picture above! I made sure that they were semi-affordable (and really cute)!
